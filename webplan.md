{0} create separate <head> .html document & link.
{0} create a <header> & {footer} .html document & link.
{0} create a <nav> .html document & link.

Thoughts;

I remember doing an .html doc with frame codes, then 3 separate .html docs to create the header, left-sidenav bar, and then the top-left corner-space that was left, usually for an icon. Then main body <section> of the whole setup was first, the index.html, then as you clicked on the links, the body would change.

This is the primary layout in my mind when it comes to designing a webpage's frontend, however the backend coding has changed dramatically since the days of the early 2000's. I started coding html in 2001 and stopped in 2003, before returning to Myspace to work on profiles in and learning the similar forum-based BBCode for GaiaOnline, both in 2005 - my Highschool Freshman year. Later on, GaiaOnline users would use CSS to create beautiful, highly-customized profiles in exchange for the website's currency. I could only read the familiar code words, but couldn't make sense of the syntax or 'grammar' of the code.

I wonder what prevented BBCode and the html that Myspace users utilized from being considered as worthwhile for a teen hobby. In the coding world, it is amateur, but it is a healthy amateurity that is a natural process of learning a new skill. It is within that willingness to be embarrassed about not knowing and having the courage to ask that we find ourselves growing and discovering who we are; our likes and dislikes, strengths and weaknesses. 

Though uncomfortability and ignorance come with mild pains; they are nearly required to obtain a full understanding of a particular subject and reach mastery - for in that climb, there are pitfalls of dunning-kruger and the uncanny valleys beyond them.
