		<h3>What Is Fallout Shelter?</h3>
			<p>Fallout Shelter is a free-to-play simulation game where you play as an Overseer running your very own Vault-Tec Corporation vault. Developed by Bethesda and released in 2015, this simple yet inticing game can be run across nearly every platform - from PC, Console, to its original Mobile app incarnation. Spend your extra minutes managing a growing community that requires Power, Water, Food, and more to survive the harsh wastelands. With the includion of exploring & combat minigames that reward the player for hard effort, Fallout Shelter is a well-rounded, well-known game that stands the test of time in an ever-changing market.

		<h3>What Is This Site?</h3>
			<p>This is my personal site for tracking my "Dwellers", as the community members are called. It can become confusing after a while who is who. I developed this in part to practice my web development skills and for future potential projects.</p>
